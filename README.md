## 💾 Browser Storage Note

**Data Persistence Warning**: Currently, the application stores data in browser memory only. This means:
- ❌ Data will be lost when you refresh the page
- ❌ Data will be lost when you close the browser tab
- ❌ Data is not shared between different browsers/devices

### Solutions for Persistent Storage

**Option 1: Local Storage (Browser-based)**
```javascript
// Add this to save data persistently in browser
function saveToLocalStorage() {
    localStorage.setItem('inventory', JSON.stringify(inventory));
}

function loadFromLocalStorage() {
    const savedInventory = localStorage.getItem('inventory');
    if (savedInventory) {
        inventory = JSON.parse(savedInventory);
    }
}
```

**Option 2: Regular CSV Exports**
- Export your data regularly using the "Export CSV" button
- Keep backups of your CSV files
- Re-import data manually when needed

**Option 3: Database Integration** (requires backend development)
- Connect to a REST API
- Implement proper CRUD operations
- Add user authentication
